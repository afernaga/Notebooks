## Classification: separation of the LMC and MW populations in Gaia data

This is an example where I trained and applied different neural network algorithms to distinguish LMC stars from MW stars.

## Entrega

Inside this folder there is a Simulation using Monte Carlo methods of the 2D Ising model. There are 2 files:
  - Fortran script of the code used to perform the simulation.
  - Pfd explaining the results.

## Example OOP code

Resolution fo the gross-pitaevski in spherical coordinates with 3 harmonic traps. Inside this folder there are 3 files: 
 - grosspita.py   :   class of the gross-pitaevski problem.
 - entregaADAM    :   notebook using the class grosspita to solve the gross-pitaevski equation.
 - calculs        :   notebook with some theory.

This notebooks where created for a class exercise. They are not as clean as they could be and they lack comments.
